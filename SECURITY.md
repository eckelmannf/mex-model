# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This repository contains actively developed documentation and schema definitions.
Changes can occur frequently and only the latest released version will be supported with
security and bug fixes. It is therefore recommended to reference only the latest
release in other documentation, schemas or implementations.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please contact the author team directly via
[email](mailto:mex@rki.de). Pull-requests with proposed solutions are explicitly
welcomed as well.
